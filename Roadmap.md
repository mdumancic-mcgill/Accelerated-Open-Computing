# Roadmap

## Vision
The vision of this project is to working with women, racialized groups, and students from underprivileged countries at McGill University to teach high-performance computing skills and inform them about available resources so that they can execute their research projects and coursework more effectively. 
The choice to implement open-science approach is to maximize the quality of this project through feedback and collaboration and the amount of students we can reach.

## Goals
1. **Expand Access to High-Performance Computing Resources**  
   Increase awareness and make sure that students from underrepresented groups and underprivileged backgrounds have access to the necessary computational tools and infrastructure.

2. **Deliver Targeted Training Programs**  
   Develop and implement workshops or courses focused on high-performance computing skills and make those available to the target group.
